### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
- Coronavirus (more formally referred to as novel Coronavirus; or COVID-19) is a large family of viruses that has newly been identified in humans. Coronavirus has proven to be a serious threat to the wellbeing of many people across the world. According to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-19-20-intl-hnk/index.html) of February 19th, 2020 there have been over 2,100 people victims as in mainland China, along with several deaths in other regions. We are interested in tracking this field because it is a genuinely concerning illness and there have been several confirmed cases even in North America.

### What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
- We came across a collection of databases on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/exnzrd/coronavirus_datasets/) in which found several data driven projects.
- One of the most detailed data driven projects that we came across was from [Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/); they created an interactive map that entails many characteristics regarding this virus in a meaningful and interactive way.
- Another data driven project regarding coronavirus comes from [CDC.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html). They have created a map showing every location with confirmed cases of this virus as well as specific information regarding cases confirmed in the US (including information regarding whether the disease spread through travel or from person to person).
- The third data driven project that we found related to this domain comes from [ECDC.Europa.Eu](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases). They have compiled a list of data regarding the distribution of cases geographically including information regarding whether the virus was locally spread or from other nations (what they refer to as imported cases). They have an interactive map detailing the specific circumstances under which the virus has spread on a case to case basis.

### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
1. How is the lethality of the virus change over time
2. According to several news sources there have been reported cases of coronavirus that have been cured. Has this made a tangible impact on decreasing the lethality of this disease over time, or is it the rate at which it is spreading more influential?
3. When does the infectiousness of the virus reach the maximum? Has the rate at which it spreading it already reached its peak (based on the given data) or is it continuing to become more extreme.
4. How many countries and regions have been infected- what is the distribution like globally of confirmed coronavirus cases?

### How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
- The data is collected from researchers at Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The data collected is compiled from the WHO as well as several other official government sources.
### How many observations (rows) are in your data?
- This dataset is being constantly updated but there are over a thousand observations (1116 as of 2/21/2020).
### How many features (columns) are in the data?
- There are five features in this data (Province/State, Country/Region, Last Update, Confirmed Case, Deaths, and Recovered Individuals)
### What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
- What is the relationship between the rate of infection and the rate of death?
- Which regions are the most severely impacted (in terms of death toll)
- Which regions have had the most recovered individuals

### How many features (columns) are in the data?
There are 8 columns in the data.
### What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
- The number of countries and regions infected
- How does the rate of infection/death/recovery cahnge over time?

### How many features (columns) are in the data?
- There are only 2 columns, the second column contains information can be split into several new columns (location, date of infection, date of death, where they were hospitialized, etc...)
### What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
- Which demographic is this virus the most lethal for (male, female, young, old, etc...)
- What region is the most lethal in terms of patients dying from coronavirus
- Which days have been the most and least severe in terms of the amount of deaths since the start of this virus
